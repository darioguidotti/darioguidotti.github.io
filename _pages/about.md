Hi there!

I am a PhD Student in Computer Science in the [Artificial Intelligence and Multi Agent Systems (AIMS)](http://www.aimslab.org/) Laboratory at [University of Genoa](https://unige.it/en/).
My research concerns the verification of learning-enabled systems, in particular the ones using Neural Networks.

You might want to check out my [CV](cv/main.pdf) to get a better picture of what I've done professionally so far.
